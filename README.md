# University of Vienna Master's practice

In this repository I collect all the practices completed during my Master's program in Computer Science in the University of Vienna.

## Summer semester 2024

- **Practicum 2: Go-ethereum Management and Monitoring Dashboard** ([source code](./p2-geth-dashboard/))   
    I implemented a tool which facilitates go-ethereum (Geth) network deployment and management. An interactive dashboard allows to launch and shutdown Geth nodes and to deploy multiple local networks; it also visualises Geth node configuration and network topology graph.

## Winter semester 2023

- **Practicum 1: Go-ethereum App based on Smart Contracts and Proof-of-Authority** ([source code](./p1-geth-app-poa/))   
    The aim of this project was to create a secure platform which facilitates decision making and provides persistent storage for a management board of a company within the Go-ethereum framework based on a Proof-of-Authority concept and Solidity Smart Contracts.

## Summer semester 2023

- **Advanced Software Engineering** ([source code](./ase))    
    I implemented 2 microservices and a queue manager library, while taking part in a team project developing an event-booking application. The queue manager library provides a unified interface for inter-service communication by implementing RPC and Pub/Sub patterns via RabbitMQ.

- **Foundations of Computer Graphics** ([source code](./computer-graphics))    
    During this course I completed 2 projects: C++ ray tracer and WebGL 3D tetris game (with Phong and Gouraud shading).

- **Information Management and Systems Engineering** ([source code](./imse))    
    I designed backend for a simple social network. It provides an API route for migrating data from PostgreSQL database (used by default) to MongoDB, and after the migration the app continues serving on MongoDB.

- **Parallel Computing** ([source code](./parallel-computing))    
    I implemented a program which solves 2D heat equation using MPI and OpenMP.
