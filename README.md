# University of Vienna Master's practice

In this repository I collect all the practices completed during my Master's program in Computer Science in the University of Vienna.

## Summer semester 2023

- **Advanced Software Engineering** ([source code](ase))    
    I implemented 2 microservices and a queue manager library, while taking part in a team project developing an event-booking application. The queue manager library provides a unified interface for inter-service communication by implementing RPC and Pub/Sub patterns via RabbitMQ.

- **Foundations of Computer Graphics** ([source code](computer-graphics))    
    During this course I completed 2 projects: C++ ray tracer and WebGL 3D tetris game (with Phong and Gouraud shading).

- **Information Management and Systems Engineering** ([source code](imse))    
    I designed backend for a simple social network. It provides an API route for migrating data from PostgreSQL database (used by default) to MongoDB, and after the migration the app continues serving on MongoDB.

- **Parallel computing** ([source code](parallel-computing))    
    I implemented a program which solves 2D heat equation using MPI and OpenMP.
